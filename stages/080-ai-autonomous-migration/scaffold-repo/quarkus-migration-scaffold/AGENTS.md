# Agent Guide

This is a corporate Quarkus **migration** scaffold. The workspace holds two
projects: you migrate the legacy application in `/projects/legacy` into this
repository (`/projects/modernized`).

## Workspace rules

- `/projects/legacy` — the application being migrated. **READ-ONLY**: read it
  for behavior, structure, and business rules; never modify, commit, or push
  it. It is not registered anywhere and has no write credentials.
- `/projects/modernized` — this repository. All new code, tests, and commits
  happen here, and only here.

## Project identity

- Quarkus application on the Red Hat build (`com.redhat.quarkus.platform` BOM
  **3.27.3.SP1**), Java 21, Maven (no wrapper — use `mvn`).
- Package root: `com.demo`.
- **Native Quarkus only** — never add `quarkus-spring-*` compatibility
  extensions to the destination (MTA may suggest them; reject).
- Default CDI scope for services and repositories: `@ApplicationScoped`.
- REST resources under `/api/`; JSON via Jackson; health at `/q/health`
  (`/q/*` deliberately sits outside the application root path).

## Build and test

The container's default Java is 17; this project targets 21. Set once per
shell:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="${JAVA_HOME_21}" && export PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

mvn quarkus:dev          # dev mode with hot reload
mvn -q clean test        # always clean — incremental builds pass on stale classes
mvn -q clean verify      # full build, mirrors the pipeline
```

## Delivery gate

Every push to `main` runs this project's pipeline: Maven build → SonarQube
quality gate → image build → deploy. The bars are exact: **zero new
violations**, **≥ 80% new-code line coverage** (tests ship with the code),
**≤ 3% duplicated new lines**. Never weaken tests or suppress rules to pass.

The repository must **build self-contained**: the pipeline resolves from
Maven Central and in-repo sources only — it cannot see your workspace. Your
local green is not the factory's green until the build passes without
workspace state.

## Hermes project-context invariant (AD-001)

Do **not** add `.hermes.md` or `HERMES.md` to this repository. Hermes loads
project context first-match-wins (`.hermes.md` → `AGENTS.md` → …); either
file would silently stop this `AGENTS.md` from loading. Enforce with:

```bash
bash scripts/check-no-hermes-context-override.sh
```
