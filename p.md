# Architecture profile
## 1. Purpose & domain
A shopping cart service managing carts, items and promotions for the coolstore shop; carts price their items against a remote product catalog and apply threshold-based shipping costs and promotions, with the expected totals pinned by the legacy suite (ShoppingCartServiceTest). The core domain concepts are the cart, its items, the product, and the promotion.
## 2. Components & relationships
The REST layer (CartEndpoint, src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/rest/CartEndpoint.java:20) depends on ShoppingCartServiceImpl which composes ShippingService and PromoService; models ShoppingCart and Product are the god nodes per the dependency analysis and carry the highest fan-in and therefore the change risk.
## 3. Integration surfaces
The catalog is consumed via an env-configured endpoint CATALOG_ENDPOINT (src/main/resources/application.properties:6), covered by preserve: CATALOG_ENDPOINT; the REST API exposes cart operations under /api/cart per the controller mappings in the endpoint class source.
## 4. Behavioral contract sources
The legacy suite ShoppingCartServiceTest pins the pricing behavior that constitutes the contract: cartItemTotal 2000.0 and shippingPromoSavings -10.99 for the two-item vehicle cart fixture (src/test/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ShoppingCartServiceTest.java:40). The checkout and set-cart flows carry no test coverage at all — a contract gap the specs must close with characterization tests before those flows are touched.
## 5. Modernization surface
The pom family must move to the Quarkus platform (javaee-pom-to-quarkus-00010 and siblings, all mandatory); imports move per javax-to-jakarta-import-00001; in-memory cart state flagged by the platform rule needs an explicit decision (src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ShoppingCartServiceImpl.java:30).
## 6. Domain boundaries
Effectively a single bounded context: the cart, pricing and promotion classes all share mutable state through the ShoppingCart model, and the dependency graph shows edges from the model package into every service class (src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore). No seam exists that would let pricing or promotion be modernized in isolation from the cart itself.
## 7. Class roles & target contract
The model classes (Product, ShoppingCart) are HARVEST — carried faithfully with legacy value pins (src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model). ShoppingCartServiceImpl is REDESIGN: target concurrency is a ConcurrentHashMap with compute() for cart state, the cache refresh-guard replaces clear-on-miss, and the API contract makes GET idempotent (404 on missing) with input validation and error mapping. CartEndpoint is REDESIGN with the same read-only GET target (src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/rest/CartEndpoint.java).
- `com.demo.SpringDataPetRepositoryImpl` (src/main/java/com/demo/SpringDataPetRepositoryImpl.java) — REDESIGN: Not a MapStruct *MapperImpl — hand-written data-access. (src/main/java/com/demo/SpringDataPetRepositoryImpl.java:31)
